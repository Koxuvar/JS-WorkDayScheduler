# WorkDay Scheduler

A work day scheduler written in javascript that allows the user to plan out and schedule their upcoming work day. The user can write a task for each hour of the working day. When the user clicks the save button at the end of the row, that task will be saved to that hour and will persist between refreshes and as long as the browser stays in the same session.
